# Variational-Inference-BNN

Project for [MA 751 Statistical Machine Learning](https://www.bu.edu/academics/grs/courses/grs-ma-751/) Final


Implemented Variational BNN by following the idea of [Practical Variational Inference for Neural Networks (2011)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4329-practical-variational-inference-for-neural-networks).

To acclerate convergence and escape local minimum, I also implemented [Good Initializations of Variational Bayes for Deep Models (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.08083.pdf).


The main result available in [Summary](https://github.com/LeonCaesa/Variational-Inference-BNN/blob/master/751_Project%20.pdf)
